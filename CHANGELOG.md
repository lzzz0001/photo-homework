### Known Limitations
- Windows-only executable (though source code is cross-platform)
- Drag-and-drop requires tkdnd library for enhanced functionality
- Large images may require scaling for optimal preview performance

### Future Considerations
- Cross-platform executable builds
- Additional watermark effects and filters
- Plugin system for custom watermark types
- Command-line interface for automation
- Multi-language support
